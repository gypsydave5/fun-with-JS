# Fun with JavaScript

A way to practice JavaScript by implementing your very own functional
library in the style of [Underscore], [lodash] and [Ramda].

## The rules

- No use of Array methods i.e. `.map`, `.forEach`
- Don't use someone else's functional library
- Have fun

## To test

`npm test`

## To make everything work

Implement the required functions in files under the `functional-library`
directory.

[lodash]: https://lodash.com/
